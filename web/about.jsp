				<h2>About Us</h2>
				We work with local people affected by conflict to improve their safety and sense of security, and conduct wider research and analysis. We use this evidence and learning to improve local, national and international policies and practices that can help build lasting peace. Our priority is people â€“ we believe that everyone should be able to lead peaceful, fulfilling lives, free from insecurity and violent conflict.

				We are a not-for-profit organisation with programmes in nearly 20 countries and territories across Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Europe. We receive funding from a range of donors including governments, the European Commission, trusts and individuals. Find out more about our funders and how you can support us.
